# Docker Miniflask

This is a base docker image (built on Linux Alpine) that contains miniconda,
flask, sqlalchamy, and a basic geospatial stack.  This image is intended to be
used within another Dockerfile - it does not provide much deployability...

For a usage example, checkout the [Miniflask
Example](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/docker_miniflask_example).
